/*
 * ThumbyNES — flash-backed disk for FatFs and TinyUSB MSC.
 *
 * The Thumby Color carries a 16 MB QSPI flash. We reserve the
 * bottom 1 MB for firmware growth and give the next 12 MB to the
 * FAT filesystem for cart storage. Three MB on the top end is
 * left as a safety margin.
 *
 *   0x10000000 .. 0x10100000   firmware (1 MB room — currently ~700 KB)
 *   0x10100000 .. 0x10D00000   FAT FS for carts (12 MB)
 *   0x10D00000 .. 0x11000000   reserved / future
 *
 * 12 MB at 4 KB clusters → 3072 clusters → well under the FAT12
 * 4084-cluster cap. Holds ~180 typical .p8.png carts.
 *
 * Sector size: 512 bytes. Erase block: 4 KB. Reads pull from the
 * XIP-mapped region directly; writes erase the containing 4 KB
 * block then program it back.
