/*
 * ThumbyNES — stdio shim for vendored state.c files.
 *
 * nofrendo's `snes/state.c` and smsplus's `state.c` both serialize
 * cart state through libc stdio (fopen / fwrite / fread / fseek /
 * fclose). The device build doesn't have libc-stdio for FAT files —
 * we use FatFs's FIL / f_open / f_write directly. This header provides
 * a tiny bridge that lets the vendored state.c files keep their
 * stdio surface unchanged: they include this header, redefine the
 * relevant calls via the STATE_* macros, and the macros expand to
 * thin FatFs-backed wrappers in thumby_state_bridge.c.
 *
 * Activated by compiling state.c with -DTHUMBY_STATE_BRIDGE so the
 * host build (which has real stdio) is unaffected.
